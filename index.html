                      Hi, my name is Kao Thao.  I'm a Web Developer based in Fresno, CA.  I like to make modern, cool and creative web designs no matter what the contents are.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                      I specialize in <b class='uppercase'>html5</b>, <b class='uppercase'>css3</b>, and <b class='capitalize'>Javascript</b> creating websites for the user's experience, one at a time.  I will work hard together with you everyday with love and great drive to reach success, completing your projects promptly.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                     I am dedicated to my craft and always strive for perfection with every new challenge.

                  <h2 class='darkgrey padding_bottom underline'>education</h2>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                      I am a Web Developer intensively trained at <b>Geekwise Academy</b>, Fresno CA in 2016.  I can design <u>Landing Pages</u>, build <u>5-page Responsive Static Websites</u>, and create bacic <u>CRUD Apps</u> using Javascript.  I use Github heavily to communicate and collaborate.  I am comfortable using Cloud9, Brackets, and GIT from the command line.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                      I hold a degree in Fine Arts from <b>CSU Fresno</b>, which contributes tremendously to this line of work.
                  </p>
                </article>
                
                <article class='about_article float_right'>
                  <h2 class='darkgrey padding_bottom underline'>professional goals</h2>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                      My aim is to use my skills to accomplish your goals.  It matters to me that the website built for you contributes to the success of your business.  It is not about me.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                      The steps it takes to acheive success mainly depend on how each aspect of my ability is applied to our collaboration and communication.  For example, a 5-Page site can be completed up to 90% within one week, each page responsive, with a fully navigational menu and all links working.   
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <p class='text_case_none'>
                      The ultimate goal is your <b>Success and Satisfaction</b>.

                              Dustybuns was a project to test my HTML and CSS skills.  More than 90% of it was completed within one week, the actual deadline goal.  It was responsive with all links working.  Issues were created and resolved in Github by a program manager, giving the feel of a real job experience.  Though we worked in groups, the project was completed individually.  One important lesson was knowing how to create dropdown menus with the input tag and positioning elements so they can be displayed correctly.  Please click on the picture above and inspect its code.

                              Geekwise Academy was the first actual project to train and strengthen my ability as a web developer.  The exercise pushed me to firmly establish my HTML and CSS skills.  The most important skill learned from this project was using Media Query to make the site responsive for desktop, tablet and mobile screens.  Learning how to build a static website with HTML tags and manipulating them visually with CSS was challenging at first but successful and you can see when you check out the code by clicking on the picture above and inspecting it.

                              Addressbook was a CRUD App created by pure vanilla Javascript.  Check out its code in Github (<a href='https://github.com/geekwise-kao-thao/addressbook'>https://github.com/geekwise-kao-thao/addressbook</a>).  The purpose was not to depend on frameworks, but to understand the fundamentals of coding so I can grasp and understand other code languages such as J-Query.  When testing this app, you will find it not 100%, but its main features should demonstrate my ability to build a CRUD App simple enough for the user's experience, but complicated enough for experienced coders to appreciate.
